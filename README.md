# Midterm Project 

### Dealing with 2018-2019 flights, passengers, and fuel consumption data 

In this repository of "Midterm", we have worked on data from 2018-2019. 

There are 5 folders in this repository Exploratory Analysis, y, z, a, b, respectedly.

### Exploratory Ananlysis
Here, there are data explorations. There are 9 Tasks and each of them are in separate folder. Inside each task's folder, you can find (1) a Jupyter file (.ipynb) which contains the code and approach to getting the answer, (2) a .csv format of the data used for the task, and (3) a google drive link of the .csv data for data files that are too large for github. 

## IMPORTANT NOTE:
In each task's .ipynb, we have obtained the data from outer source and saved the final, workable file to .csv in the task's folder. **PLEASE DO NOT** touch the code of how we obtained the data because you will get error. 

This is because this Midterm is a project we completed under supervision of Lighthouse Labs, and the data they provided are accessible to its students. Use the final data we obtained and saved in each folder. 

### Feature Engineering
In this folder, you can only see .ipynb (jupyter notebooks) files. The codes are written in the files and you can see our approach for feature engineering.

### Modeling
This is where we have our final files aka modeling codes. There are specific folders such as classification and regression for each task we did. Inside each modeling's folder, you can see different types of algorithms ordered alephatibatically. You can find .ipynb notebooks that contain the algorithms we applied. Also, we might have .csv files if the size doesn't exceed github's minimum. Otherwise, we will leave a google drive link for the data.
